# Robust Campaign Drafts + Start Flow â€” Implementation Plan

**Overall Progress:** `88%`

## Tasks

- [x] ğŸŸ© Step 1: Add Start Source modal (composer)
  - [x] ğŸŸ© Create `StartSourceModal` with three options: Start Blank, Automation Preset, From a Draft
  - [x] ğŸŸ© Show modal on `/dashboard/[companyId]/campaigns/new` when no `draftId`/prefill and no consumed session prefill
  - [x] ğŸŸ© Wire actions: Blank (close + mark session as blank), Preset (link to dashboard automations), Drafts (open Drafts modal)
  - [x] ğŸŸ© Clear any consumed `sessionStorage.draft_email_content` immediately after applying

- [x] ğŸŸ© Step 2: Implement Drafts modal (list/open/delete)
  - [x] ğŸŸ© Build `DraftsModal` that fetches `/api/drafts?companyId=<id>` sorted by `updated_at` desc
  - [x] ğŸŸ© Show "Resume last updated" tile + list (subject, snippet, updated time)
  - [x] ğŸŸ© Open: call `loadDraft(id)` and set subject/preview/styles; close modal
  - [x] ğŸŸ© Delete: call `DELETE /api/drafts/[id]` with confirm; update list without full reload

- [x] ğŸŸ© Step 3: Update CampaignComposerProvider logic
  - [x] ğŸŸ© Remove auto-load of most recent draft for plain `/campaigns/new` loads
  - [x] ğŸŸ© Add flags: `prefillConsumed`, `userInteracted` to control autosave gating
  - [x] ğŸŸ© Suppress autosave until user interaction (subject/preview/editor change)
  - [x] ğŸŸ© On successful `create()`: if `draftId` exists, `DELETE /api/drafts/[id]` then route to campaign
  - [x] ğŸŸ© On leave (route change): prompt "Save as draft or discard?"; save uses force save, discard deletes existing draft (if any)

- [x] ğŸŸ© Step 4: Extend autosave hook for suppression
  - [x] ğŸŸ© Add config to `useDraftAutoSave` to defer saving until `userInteracted === true`
  - [x] ğŸŸ© Keep existing API; expose `saveDraft` (force) unchanged
  - [x] ğŸŸ© Maintain `beforeunload` warning but do not silently save; rely on provider prompt for client nav

- [x] ğŸŸ© Step 5: Harden drafts API by company scope
  - [x] ğŸŸ© `GET /api/drafts/[id]`: accept optional `companyId` and enforce `.eq('company_id', companyId)`
  - [x] ğŸŸ© Mirror the check for `PUT`/`DELETE` when `companyId` is provided

- [x] ğŸŸ© Step 6: Add "Open Drafts" entry on Campaigns page
  - [x] ğŸŸ© `app/dashboard/[companyId]/campaigns/page.tsx`: add secondary "Open Drafts" button next to "New campaign"
  - [x] ğŸŸ© Wire it to open `DraftsModal` (via client wrapper state or route flag)

- [x] ğŸŸ© Step 7: Use existing dashboard automations page
  - [x] ğŸŸ© Link "Automation Preset" to `/dashboard/[companyId]/automations`
  - [x] ğŸŸ© Keep current prefill contract: set `sessionStorage.draft_email_content` + `prefillSubject`/`prefillPreview` on return

- [ ] ğŸŸ¥ Step 8: Validate critical flows
  - [ ] ğŸŸ¥ New â†’ Start Blank â†’ edit â†’ leave â†’ prompt â†’ Save as draft â†’ reopen from Drafts
  - [ ] ğŸŸ¥ New â†’ From Draft â†’ edit â†’ create campaign â†’ draft removed
  - [ ] ğŸŸ¥ New â†’ Automation preset â†’ content appears â†’ no autosave until edit â†’ leave prompt works
  - [ ] ğŸŸ¥ New â†’ Template picker â†’ apply â†’ no autosave until edit â†’ continue editing
  - [ ] ğŸŸ¥ Ensure plain new page no longer autoloads a draft


## Notes
- Draft naming uses subject only (no separate title field).
- Drafts are scoped to current user; no sharing for now.
- No changes to experiences/* routes; use dashboard paths only.
- No search in Drafts modal; sort by last updated; paginate later if needed.
